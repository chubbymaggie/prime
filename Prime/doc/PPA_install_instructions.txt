How to obtain the PPA plugin projects
=====================================
The PPA projects can be downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/barthe/ppa/downloads
In addition, in order to build it, a log4j bundle must be downloaded. One is provided alongside the Prime repository.

Fix for eclipse 3.7
===================
There was a typo in a class and interface in Eclipse 3.6, which was fixed in 3.7. PPA uses that class, so in order for it to work with Eclipse 3.7 you need to fix all occurrences of that class/interface accordingly:
INameEnviromentWithProgress  ->  INameEnvironmentWithProgress
NameEnviromentWithProgress   ->  NameEnvironmentWithProgress
These occurrences appear in the file org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.PPACompilationUnitResolver, in the project ca.mcgill.cs.swevo.ppa.

Fix to enable timeouts / cancel requests
========================================
PPA will not respond to timeouts or cancel requests; to enable it to respond to them, the following modification should be made:
File: org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.PPABindingUtil
Method: public static boolean isUnknownType(ITypeBinding typeBinding) - it appears around line 1050
Insert at start of method:

if (Thread.interrupted()) {
	Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
	throw new RuntimeException(new InterruptedException());
}
